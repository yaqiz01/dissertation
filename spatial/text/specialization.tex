\section{Specialization}
\label{specialization}








%For Spatial, this means that only around 700 total design points need to be estimated to closely approximate the accelerator's area/performance Pareto front, even for extremely large spaces.
%The compiler can then further tune the total number of initial random samples based on the complexity of the application.
%, making this autotuner suitable for real applications.

% \subsection{FPGAs}
% An FPGA is conceptually a large, flattened fabric of registers, SRAMs, and logic with off-chip DRAM being its 
% only notion of hierarchy.  It offers bit-level flexibility when mapping applications and can compose these bit-level
% operations to create logical bus-level operations. As a consequence of being so flexible, it takes a very long time to 
% map RTL designs to it.


% \subsection{Plasticine}

% Plasticine is a tiled-based hierarchical architecture that has three major types of coarse-grain
% resources: Pattern compute units (PCU) are processing element with SIMD data path that can map
% unrolled inner loop body. Pattern memory units (PMU) contain a banked scratchpad with single lane 
% pipeline stages to map address calculation. On the fringe, there are specialized address
% generators (AG) to map calculation of off-chip address. 

% To target hierarchical architecture with limited stages inside each PCU, Spatial tries to split
% large loop body into multiple PCU by iteratively partitioning the inner loop data flow graph to satisfy the 
% number of stages, fan-in, fan-out, and maximum live variables requirements of each PCU.
% Additionally, Spatial extracts address calculation of the on-chip scratchpad and map those
% stages into PMU to eliminate round trip communication overhead with PCU. Finally, Spatial performs a couple
% of optimizations to reduce usage of PCU.

% Once spatial constructs are lowered into ``virtual'' Plasticine CUs, a Plasticine low-level
% compiler is used to perform placement and routing, mapping of the internal primitives, and
% generate Plasticine configuration binary.
