\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

In this work, we presented Spatial, a new domain-specific language for the design of application accelerators on reconfigurable architectures.
Spatial includes hardware-specific abstractions for control, memory, and design tuning which help to provide a balance 
between productive and performance-driven accelerator design.
We have demonstrated that Spatial can target a range of reconfigurable architectures from a single source, and can achieve average
speedups of $2.9\times$ over SDAccel with 42\% less code. 

The Spatial language and compiler is an ongoing, open source project at Stanford. Related documentation and releases can be found at \url{https://spatial.stanford.edu}.
