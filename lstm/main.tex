  % Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
  % Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

  % You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
  % Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
  % in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.
