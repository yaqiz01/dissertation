With the end of Dennard Scaling~\cite{dennard}, the amount of performance one can extract from a CPU is reaching a limit.
To provide general-purpose flexibility, CPU spends the majority of energy on overheads, including dynamic-instruction execution, branch prediction, and a cache hierarchy, and less than 20\% of the energy on the actual computation~\cite{mark}.
Even worse, the power wall is limiting the entire multicore family
to reach the doubled performance improvement per generation enabled by technology scaling in the past\cite{multicorescale}.
