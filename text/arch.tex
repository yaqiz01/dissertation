\chapter{Architecture} \label{sec:arch}

In this section, we discuss the architectural advancement on top of the original Plasticine architecture
introduced in~\cite{plasticine}. These architectural additions either help increase the application
coverage or improve the mapping strategies of existing applications by supporting new language
constructs, data types, and improving resource utilizations.
Specifically, \Cref{sec:network} provides an extensive study on on-chip network selection for
reconfigurable spatial architectures;
\Cref{sec:rnn_arch} discusses the hardware specialization and architectural sizing for machine
learning applications; 
\Cref{sec:banking_arch} layouts the changes in datapaths to support more
flexible banking schemes required by the general access patterns supported in Spatial.
