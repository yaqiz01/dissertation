  Plasticine's latency and throughout improvement over V100 GPU.
  The evaluated Plasticine architecture has area footprint of 352$mm^2$ at 28nm.
  V100 GPU has area footprint of 815$mm^2$ at 12nm.
  Both platforms have the same off-chip bandwidth at 1TB/s with HBM technology.
  Yellow and blue bars show the raw measured speedup in throughput and latency, respectively.
  To account for the resource discrepancy, the pink bar shows the normalized throughput
  for compute-bound application--SqueezeNet and LSTM, which scales performance with additionally
  on-chip resources.
