%In this talk, I will talk about architectural design and compilation techinques that improves the scaling efficiency of a RDA developed 
%at Stanford--Plasticine.
%Staring with a static-dynamic hybrid network, we show that the hybrid network can improves energy efficiency while providing
%guaranteed success in placement and routing.
%Next, I will talk about compiler techinques that convert applications' complex control hierarchies, such as nested loops and branch conditions, into a streaming dataflow representation that can be efficiently executed by Plasticine with distributed on-chip resources.
%The compiler implements (a) a peer-to-peer (p2p) control paradigm inferred from an imperative programming style that minimizes synchronization overhead, and (b) a mapping strategy that decomposes the computation and memory in a program across a distributed heterogeneous resources.
%By applying these techniques, we show that Plasticine is able to outperform state of art accelerators, such as GPUs and FPGAs, in
%both performance and performance/Watt in various dense, sparse, and streaming applications.

With the slowdown of Mooreâ€™s Law, specialized hardware accelerators are gaining tractions 
for delivering 100-1000x performance improvement over general-purpose processors. 
As the performance scaling in multicores is coming to a limit~\cite{multicorescale}, a new
class of accelerators--reconfigurable dataflow architectures (RDAs)--is promising in 
offering high-throughput and energy-efficient acceleration that keeps up with the performance demand.
Instead of dynamically fetching instructions like in traditional processors, RDAs have flexible datapath 
that can be statically configured to spatially parallelize and pipeline the program across
distributed on-chip resources. 
The pipelined execution model and explicitly-managed scratchpad in RDAs eliminate
the performance, area, and energy overhead in dynamic scheduling and conventional memory hierarchy.

To adapt to the compute intensity in modern data-analytic workloads, particularly in the deep learning
domain, RDAs are increasing to a scale that was unprecedented before, compared to the classic coarse-grained
reconfigurable architectures (CGRAs).
With an area footprint of $133\text{mm}^2$ at 28nm, 
Plasticine is a hierarchical RDA with 12.3 TFLOPs of compute power~\cite{plasticine}.
Prior work has shown an up to 76x performance/watt benefit from Plasticine over a Stradix V FPGA 
due to advantage in clock frequency and resource density.
The increase in scale introduces new challenges in on-chip network design to maintain 
the throughput and energy efficiency of RDAs.
Furthermore, targeting and managing RDAs at this scale also require new strategies in mapping, 
memory management, and flexible control to fully utilize the compute power of the accelerator. 

In this work, we focus on two aspects of the software-hardware co-design that impact the usability
and scalability of the Plasticine accelerator. 
One of the biggest challenges that hinders the adoption of these
accelerators is the low-level declarative configuration interface that requires the programmers to
have detailed knowledge about the underlying microarchitecture implementation and hardware
constraints. To address the programmability challenge, we introduce a compiler stack that provides a high-level
programming interface that efficiently translates imperative control constructs to streaming
dataflow execution with minimum synchronization overhead on an on-chip distributed architecture. The
compiler handles the hardware constraints systematically with resource virtualization. To address
the performance challenges, we present a comprehensive study on the on-chip network design for 
reconfigurable dataflow architectures that sustain performance in a scalable fashion with high energy efficiency.
