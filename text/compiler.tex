\chapter{Compiler} \label{sec:compiler}

In this section, we introduce the compiler framework---\name---that targets Plasticine
architecture from high-level programs described in the Spatial language. 

In the following sections, \Cref{sec:control} describes conversion from an imperative paradigm with
a nested control hierarchy to the distributed streaming dataflow execution.
\Cref{sec:resalloc} details program-partitioning passes that decompose program over distributed resources.
\Cref{sec:opt} enumerates several optimizations in \name, and \Cref{sec:par} discuss about PaR and
heuristic generation.
