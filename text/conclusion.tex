\chapter{Conclusions (WIP)}

We show that the best network design depends on both applications and the underlying accelerator architecture.
Network performance correlates strongly with bandwidth for streaming accelerators, and scaling raw bandwidth is more area- and energy-efficient with a static network.
We show that the application mapping can be optimized to move less data by using a dynamic network as a fallback from a high-bandwidth static network.
%this contributes a 6.9x average performance per area and 2.3x average energy-efficiency improvement for a static-dynamic hybrid network.
This static-dynamic hybrid network provides a 1.8x energy-efficiency and
2.8x performance advantage over the purely static and purely dynamic networks, respectively.
  %Furthermore, we show that spatial architectures require larger switches as programs get bigger, imposing super-linear scaling of network size with chip area.
