% basically this is a template file, you should be able to take it and
% start running.

% the philosophy behind this template is that each chapter or
% chapterlike section goes in a separate file and you use the \include
% command to input it into the final document.  The \includeonly
% command can be used so you only need to work on one or two chapters at a
% time (instead of having to either latex the entire book each time or
% losing cross-references and page numbering)

% copy this file and call it something like mythesis.tex

\documentclass[11pt]{report}
% note that the documentclass can take other option such as
% twoside - for double sided printing
% openright - if double side  chapters always start on odd pages
% openany - if double side chapters start on the next page even or odd
% 12pt can be replaced by 11pt

\usepackage{suthesis-2e}
% options are
% online - now the default
% hardcopy - turns off online includes signature page and copyright page in file 
% engineer - does an engineer thesis instead of a PhD dissertation

%% load other packages you need

%% uncomment the following and create mythesis-macros.sty for all your
%% own macros.  This keeps this top level file looking fairly neat.
% \usepackage{mythesis-macros}

%% certain types of theses require special title page format.  See the
%% style file for the full list.  An example would be that for some of
%% the language departments. 
% \dualthesis \dept{Asian Languages} \languagemajor{Korean} 
%% or education
% \educationthesis

\title{Scaling a Reconfigurable Dataflow Accelerator}
\author{Yaqi Zhang}
%\dept{} % default is Computer Science, uncomment for other departments
\principaladviser{Kunle Olukotun}
% \coprincipaladvisor{}
\firstreader{Subhasish Mitra}
\secondreader{Matei Zaharia}
% \thirdreader{}

%the following command would (if uncommented) allow  only chapter1 and
%chapter2 to be processed
%\includeonly{chapter1,chapter2}

% if you feel real savvy use
% \typein{Now put in includeonly}
% the \typein command stops latex at this point and allows you to type
% in a command such as
% \includeonly{chapter3,chapter5}
% this can save some time and means you don't have to edit this file
% as much.

\input{text/setting}

\begin{document}

% first the preface sections.

\include{text/abstract}
\include{text/acknowledgement}

%% afterpreface produces a table of contents and any other tables
