abstract="Reconfigurable computational architectures are envisioned to deliver power efficient, high performance, flexible platforms for embedded systems design. The coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture ADRES (Architecture for Dynamically Reconfigurable Embedded Systems) and its compiler offer a tool flow to design sparsely interconnected 2D array processors with an arbitrary number of functional units, register files and interconnection topologies. This article presents an architectural exploration methodology and its results for the first implementation of the ADRES architecture on a 90nm standard-cell technology. We analyze performance, energy and power trade-offs for two typical kernels from the multimedia and wireless domains: IDCT and FFT. Architecture instances of different sizes and interconnect structures are evaluated with respect to their power versus performance trade-offs. An optimized architecture is derived. A detailed power breakdown for the individual components of the selected architecture is presented.",

abstract="The coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures have advantages over the traditional FPGAs in terms of delay, area and configuration time. To execute entire applications, most of them combine an instruction set processor(ISP) and a reconfigurable matrix. However, not much attention is paid to the integration of these two parts, which results in high communication overhead and programming difficulty. To address this problem, we propose a novel architecture with tightly coupled very long instruction word (VLIW) processor and coarse-grained reconfigurable matrix. The advantages include simplified programming model, shared resource costs, and reduced communication overhead. To exploit this architecture, our previously developed compiler framework is adapted to the new architecture. The results show that the new architecture has good performance and is very compiler-friendly.",

abstract = "The modern science of networks has made significant advancement in the modeling of complex real-world systems. One of the most important features in these networks is the existence of community structure. In recent years, many community detection algorithms have been proposed to unveil the structural properties and dynamic behaviors of networks. In this study, we attempt a contemporary survey on the methods of community detection and its applications in the various domains of real life. Besides highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each community detection approach, different aspects of algorithmic performance comparison and their testing on standard benchmarks are discussed. The challenges faced by community detection algorithms, open issues and future trends related to community detection are also postulated. The main goal of this paper is to put forth a review of prevailing community detection algorithms that range from traditional algorithms to state of the art algorithms for overlapping community detection. Algorithms based on dimensionality reduction techniques such as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and principal component analysis (PCA) are also focused. This study will serve as an up-to-date report on the evolution of community detection and its potential applications in various domains from real world networks."
